# Introduction

Very simple library for webcam native video capture that uses [Nokhwa](https://github.com/l1npengtul/nokhwa) to export basic C functions so they can be called from any language such as Java, Python, etc.

This was built to be used with JNA in https://github.com/eduramiba/webcam-capture-driver-native
